## ParametersSample
Introduction for using CID parameters. Reading and writing values to a parameter from script and from user interface.
### Description
This App contains a CID parameters file where some variables are declared. The parameter
values are changed depending on any change of DI1 or on any change in the user interface.
The parameter values can also be saved permanently. These parameters can contain various
variable types and also structures. The variable values can be read and written from the
script. Also a direct binding to a user interface control is possible.
### How to run
The sample can be run using the emulator. The values will be printed to
the console on initialization and on any change. The keyboard key 1 can be used
inside the emulator tab to toggle the digital input. The user interface can be
accessed by opening a web browser on localhost (127.0.0.1). The values can be
changed in the user interface and pressing "Save permanent" will save the parameters,
so that they keep their value even after rebooting the device.
